> for medium size business HR

A simple attendance tracking program for tracking employee time off. This includes several types of leave taking such 
as holiday and sick leave, with the option of adding other types of leave with lessened functionality.

## Leave Tracking

### Holiday tracking

In this attendance program, holiday is accrued every year on the anniversary of the employee and is accumulated year by
year.

### Sick leave tracking

In this program, sick leave is accrued at a given rate (0.5 days default) per month and is reset on every calendar year

### Bereavement, LOA, custom types

Custom leaves can (maybe, hopefully, probably) be specified, details to come

## TODO

### Structure

- Finalize the first draft of functionality available to an employee
- Construct the tests for functionality of "Employee" class
- Determine structure of the interface for "Leave" and determine the implementations in its subtypes

### UI
