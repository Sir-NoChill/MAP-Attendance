> for medium size business HR

A simple attendance tracking program for tracking employee time off. This includes several types of leave taking such 
as holiday and sick leave, with the option of adding other types of leave with lessened functionality.

## Leave Tracking

### Holiday tracking

In this attendance program, holiday is accrued every year on the anniversary of the employee and is accumulated year by
year.

### Sick leave tracking

In this program, sick leave is accrued at a given rate (0.5 days default) per month and is reset on every calendar year

### Bereavement, LOA, custom types

Custom leaves can (maybe, hopefully, probably) be specified, details to come

## TODO

That is to say, I don't know where to start but I'm sure I'll figure it out
given about two days of google
